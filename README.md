# Snake-Game
Native Javascript (ECMAScript6) Snake Game.

Simple Snake game written in Native Javascript. I tried to stick with ECMAScript 6 standards as far as possible. There are scope of improvements to the code. 

Inspired by the Coding Challenge channel in youtube by "The Code Train". The code in Coding Challenge was developed using p5.js library. 

Feel free to download a copy or Fork and play around with the code.
